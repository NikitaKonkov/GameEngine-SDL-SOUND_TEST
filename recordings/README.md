# Music Recordings

This directory contains saved music recordings from the SDL sound application.

Each file is saved with a timestamp in the filename and contains the sequence of notes played.
The format is CSV with three columns:
1. Timestamp (ms)
2. Sound name
3. Action (Down/Up)

You can use these recordings to replay your musical performances later.
